    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>24 pieces Graham crackers (20-24 pieces)</li>
        <li>500 ml all-purpose cream (2 packs)</li>
        <li>300 ml sweetened condensed milk (1 can)</li>
        <li>4 small-medium ripe mangoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chill the all-purpose cream the fridge overnight or in the freezer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel the skin off the mangoes. Cut away the sides (flesh) from the pit. 
            Lay the mango halves flat-side down on a cutting board. 
            Cut the flesh lengthwise into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer chilled all-purpose cream in a large bowl. 
            If you like it lighter and fluffier, whip it with a hand mixer until it doubles in volume.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the sweetened condensed milk to the all-purpose cream until well blended.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of a rectangular or square (8x8 or 6x6) glass dish (or something similar) with a layer Graham crackers then pour 
            and spread Â¼ of the cream mixture on top of the crackers and then top with mango slices.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until 4 layers are formed, ending with the cream and mango slices on top. 
                You can arrange the mango slices for the top in an overlapping manner for design.</li>
            <li>Chill for at least 3-5 hours to set completely. 
                You know it is ready when the Graham becomes soft and fluffy and no longer dry. 
                You can also freeze it at this point before serving.</li>
    </ol>
